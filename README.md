#About
[Device] Night proximity sensor that:

● Can send a notification to the web UI when an object is closer to the sensor than a set
threshold.
● Has a sensor that makes it operate only in night mode (i.e. low light conditions)
● Can be turned on or off (both sensors) from the web UI.
● Should have an LED to indicate whether the sensors are on or off.
● Has a configurable threshold from the web UI.

[Cloud] Build, connect and deploy the infrastructure:

● Write a filter in the Logstash configuration file so that its output contains light sensor data
for low light conditions only.
● Create relevant visualizations (graphs) in Kibana for light sensor data and corresponding
current distance from the range sensor
● Create a Dashboard in Kibana for the above visualizations and embed it into the web UI.

[Web App] Web interface that:


● Receive a notification when an object crosses the threshold limit set for the
sensor
● Show a count that aggregates the number of times it receives a notification.
● Allow the user to set / reset the threshold for the range sensor.
● Have the Kibana dashboard embedded into the page.
● Have a button to turn the sensors on/off.
● Can display user readable sensor data (Eg: convert light sensor range to 0% to 100%)

#Setup and execution of the code

•	Raspberry Pi

Sudo apt-get install python-default 
Sudo apt-get install paho-mqtt
Connection as mentioned above or follow connection diagram/screenshots
Run sensor.py python script

•	Server / VM
	
MQTT	
Open the mosquito.conf file and add listeners 1883, 8001 and protocol websockets.
Netstat -tulpen to check MQTT is running and listening on port 1883
mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf to restart mosquito service with specified config file.

Kafka	
vi ~/kafka/config/server.properties
Add delete.topic.enable = true
vi ~/kafka/bin/kafka-server-start.sh
Add export KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS="-Xmx256m -Xms256m”
Run ~/kafka/bin/kafka-server-start.sh ~/kafka/config/server.properties to start the Kafka server

MQTT and Kafka bridge	
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install paho-mqtt
sudo pip install kaka-python
python bridge.py

ElasticSearch	
cd ~/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-2.2.1
netstat -tulpen to check whether ElasticSearch is in listening on port 9200
Go to ~/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-2.2.1 
./bin/elasticsearch to start ElasticSearch

Kibana	
cd ~/kibana/kibana-4.4.2-linux-x64
vi config/kibana.yml
Add elasticsearch.url: “http://localhost:9200" for connecting Elasticsearch to Kibana
cd ~/kibana/kibana-4.4.2-linux-x64 and Execute ./bin/kibana to start the Kibana server
Open  http:// 54.153.69.222:5801 

LogStash	
cd ~/logstash/logstash-2.2.2
Edit the Logstash.conf file to add required input , filter and output plugins to consider only low light data..	•	Run bin/logstash agent -f logstash.conf
to start the LogStash

•	Web Application
Install nodejs and npm
‘npm install’ to install all dependencies from package.json
Run ‘node webapp.js’ to start web application server.
Open ‘http://54.67.98.63:8080> to view the web application.
